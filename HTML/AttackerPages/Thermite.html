<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>Trace joined the Corps straight out of high school, making him a fourth-generation Marine. Following his first tour of Iraq, he obtained enough experience to volunteer as an explosive ordnance disposal technician. After his second tour of Iraq, Trace returned to the U.S., enrolled at Texas A&M, and earned a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. He brought his experiences and skills to the FBI, where he spent fours years as a field agent with the Hazardous Materials Response Unit. Seeking more dynamic environments, Trace transferred into FBI SWAT, where he excelled at developing new barricade protocols. He then earned a spot in Rainbow where he's shown further interest in research and development on gadget upgrades. Trace's hometown of Plano has a major concentration of Chinese Americans, and as such Trace has conversational level of Mandarin.</p>

<p>For someone so disciplined and orderly, Specialist Jordan "Thermite" Trace likes to surprise. He can be a practical joker and he's always ready with a smart aleck comment. Beneath the surface, however ,the recent loss of his sister to cancer, and the death of his mother a few years prior, have made it difficult for him to channel his thoughts and energy with the focus to which he is accustomed.[…] I am concerned that he uses humor to avoid his grief. It's important he understands that some coping mechanisms can delay the healing process. There are resources that can help him, and I will continue to offer them when and where I may.</p>

<p>Trace demonstrates strong tactical leadership, but can also plow ahead without consensus. I don't believe there's any lasting friction with other team members. He's well-liked by the others and has a solid working relationship with Specialists Yumiko "Hibana" Imagawa, Mike "Thatcher" Baker, and Emmanuelle "Twitch" Pichon. He can be quite the social-butterfly in his downtime.</p>
