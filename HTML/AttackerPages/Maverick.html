<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>Bostonian Erik Thorn came from a multilingual home and ranked in the top 2% in intelligence. While his parents were loving, they were extremely protective and did not allow him to explore his own childhood neighborhood. This eventually led him to enlist in the U.S. Army after high school where he rose in rank over a short period of time. He learned Dari, and became an Intelligence Officer, serving in Kabul as foreign reporters, adventurers, and criminals flocked to the city. Thorn was well known in the underground club circuit and even among locals as a proficient Buzkashi player.</p>

<p>Thorn was invited into the Unit as their regional specialist. Following selection, he remained in country gathering intel, building networks of allies and safe houses, and tracking hostiles. As the situation in Kabul worsened, Thorn kept tabs on Americans, rescuing them when necessary, and helping locals escape the violence. He was investigating a missing reporter when the Unit lost contact with him. After two years of silence, he was discovered by Nøkk and re-emerged with enough intel to dismantle a major insurgency operation. There were still questions regarding his disappearance, but he was exonerated and his testimony sealed. His successful missions, along with his expertise, gained him the attention of Six.</p>

<p>I knew Specialist Erik "Maverick" Thorn well before his disappearance. He was a legend among Intelligence Collectors as the spook who “went native.” He’s often difficult to engage with since he’s incredibly intelligent and able to read others with remarkable intensity, but ask him about Kabul or Buzkashi and he can barely contain his excitement.</p>
