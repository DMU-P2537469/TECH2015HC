<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>Azucena Rocío Quispe was born on May 6, 1971 in Cojata, Puru. She suffered a difficult childhood but was provided with plenty of friendly rivalries through her siblings and cousins. Her grandmother, Kantuta Quispe, frequently told her stories of her great-grandfather, Isaías Quispe and instilled in her a hope that he would one day return to them, despite the fact that he had gone missing in 1925. While attending her grandmother's funeral in 1994, Azucena was horrified to learn that she had previously burned all of Isaías' letter during one of her hallucinatory periods. Despite this irreplaceable loss of family history, Azucena's Aunt gifted her an old compass that once belonged to the famous English explorer Percy Fawcett who had gifted it to Kantuta as a child.</p>

<p>Azucena soon began her career as an anthropologist concerned with the preservation of Peru's shared cultural heritage. Her unique familial link to colonial explorers of the 20th century gave her uncommon insight into both how voyages of discovery can shape cultural consciousness, and into the deep and abiding loss created when a shared cultural touchstone is lost. She served for several years in the Policía Nacional Perú (PNP), before reorienting as a freelance archaeologist focused on the discovery and categorization of new archaeological sites. After several run-ins with antiquities traffickers, and failed attempts to bring them down from within, she turned to guerilla tactics and founded the Asociación de patrullero cultural Arqueológico (APCA) in order to seize important cultural discoveries for the Peruvian State.</p>

<p>In 1999, Azucena met a young César "Goyo" Hernández following a bombing that had destroyed his home, killed his father, and severely injured his mother. Azucena taught Hernández to observe his surroundings and to avoid the other boys his age who had been drawn into gang-related affairs. She later encouraged him to enroll at the Heroic Naval Military School. By 2019, Azucena had already spent some 20-odd years in the jungles of Peru, fighting the cartels on her own terms. Through Hernández, Harry Pandey contacted Azucena and successfully recruited her into Rainbow.</p>
