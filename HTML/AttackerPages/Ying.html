<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>Siu Mei Lin was born on May 12, 1983 in the comfortable Central district of Hong Kong. Her mother was a Hong Kong government worker and she grew up surrounded by adults who regularly discussed serious topics. Around age ten, Mei Lin grew tired of these boring conversations and often slipped away to wander the city. Immediately after graduating from secondary school, Mei Lin became a close protection operative. With a private tuition, she developed explosive short-range power and combat skills.</p>

<p>In 2004, Mei Lin participated in Operation High Sun. During the mission, she had an altercation with Spetsnaz Operator Shurat "Fuze" Kessikbayev, considering him to be a "questionable asset" due to believing he had a disregard for civilian lives. The situation was only resolved after FBI SWAT Operator Eliza "Ash" Cohen had stepped in. In 2005, she collaborated with the Japanese Special Assault Team where she met Masaru "Echo" Enatsu. Both of them became romantically involved with one another before breaking up a year later.</p>

<p>Aiming to become an all-purpose operative, Mei Lin traveled to a female exclusive training facility in Tel Aviv, Israel. She spent two years training and serving with the Caracal Battalion where she developed an expertise in firearms and combat driving maneuvers. After completing her program, Mei Lin returned to Hong Kong. In 2008, she reoriented her career toward the police force after being involved in a kidnapping situation. She was first recruited to the Hong Kong police force to review the processes used by the Police Tactical Force's Security Wing. During this time, her interest to lead international rescue operations grew, which drove her to apply to the elite SDU: Flying Tigers. Joint training with the SAS and her creative use of flashbangs earned Mei Lin the codename, Ying (Firefly). Lin's experience in close protection allowed her to ensure minimum casualties while leading high-risk VIP and witness protection operations amidst Hong Kong's dense urban population. This expertise ultimately got Mei Lin recruited by Rainbow in 2017.</p>
