<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>Liu Tze Long was born on July 2nd, 1972 in Tseung Kwan O (Junk Bay). He was raised by his father, who worked for a ship breaking company and often pulled double shifts. Liu's early years were spent working alongside his father in the stripping obsolete tankers for raw materials and parts. Growing up surrounded by hazardous materials and seeing their long-term effects on his fellow workers left Liu with an abiding respect for toxins and their effect on the human body. At 10 years old, he fell in an oil tank while scavenging an old ship and ingested a large amount of toxins while trying to break free. As the ship breaking business began to dwindle out, Liu and his father took some demolition jobs under the table. It all came to a stop when Liu's father injured his back. Liu was 19 and could not support them both with his own income. Quickly crumbling under debts, he seeked additional income by volunteering for mine clearing duties in the provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi.</p>

<p>After two years of defusing hazardous ammunitions, Liu's abilities and bravery caught the attention of key personnel within the Hong Kong Police Department. He then returned to Hong Kong and joined the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau. This gave Liu the opportunity to continue his chemistry and forensics-based education along with intensive on-site training. His expertise later enabled him to join the Special Duties Unit (SDU) to deal with Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear terrorist threats. Lesion's first operation was Operation Green Viper in Indonesia and Macau. He teamed up and joined forces with SAS Operators Mike "Thatcher" Baker and James "Smoke" Porter. Upon completion of the mission, the two helped celebrate Lesion's first successful mission with an extra day in Macau, filing the event as an off-duty bonus.</p>

<p>In 2017, Liu was formally recruited into Rainbow. His past expertise in CBRN threats made him a clear first pick during the formation of Rainbow's CBRN Threat Unit in early 2018. Liu regularly consults with Rainbow's tech experts to help Olivier "Lion" Flament and Lera "Finka" Melnikova implement better response solutions for the CBRN Threat Unit.</p>
