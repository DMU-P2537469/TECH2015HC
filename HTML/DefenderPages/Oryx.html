<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>Little is known about Al Hadid's life. He grew up in a small town adjacent to an air force base, and by all accounts led a normal life up until he was torn from his family as a teenager. For over fifteen years, Al Hadid struggled for his freedom and was frequently moved between solitary confinement and different facilities. He eventually broke free and resurfaced in Jordan, but stayed only long enough to obtain a new passport. He learned wrestling in Istanbul, Muay Thai in Bangkok, tactical driving in Berlin, and precision marksmanship in Damascus, likely working for a paramilitary sponsor. Then he disappeared again.</p>

<p>He next showed up as a cadet at Jalal "Kaid" El Fassi's Fortress. As the years passed, his role evolved, from recruit to steward to instructor. Now the unofficial second-in-command, Al Hadid maintains the Fortress during Kaid's absences and acts as a trusted advisor whenever the two of them are together.</p>

<p>Rumors of Al Hadid's ferocity abound, but remain uncorroborated by field reports and should be disregarded.</p>

<p>While his past remains a mystery, Saif “Oryx” Al Hadid’s present is one of extraordinary finesse. While unassuming in everyday life, he is capable of physical feats long considered impossible. Calm, collected, yet impenetrable, he embodies the axiom that still waters do, indeed, run deep.</p>

<p>Saif "Oryx" Al Hadid has lived an exceptional life. Torn from his family as a teenager, he was outside of Jordan - he won't say where - where he was incarcerated. For over fifteen years he struggled for his freedom, moving between solitary confinement and different facilities. The rage he bears as a result of this inhumane treatment is something I have witnessed once, and hope to never see again.</p>

<p>My first meeting with Al Hadid took place not in my own office, but in the well-appointed private sanctuary of Jalal "Kaid" El Fassi. He had told me stories of the warrior forged from raw iron, of his outstanding strength and resilience, but also of the weeks during which the man had sat, unmoving, in the scorching desert heat, waiting for Kaid to open the Fortress' doors.</p>

<p>Though no outward mark remains of his transformation, it is clear Al Hadid is a man thoroughly changed.

We spoke of the ubiquitous cars of Morocco, of his trek, on foot, from Syria to the Atlas Mountains, and of poetry, for which he has a special fondness.</p>
