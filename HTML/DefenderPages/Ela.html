<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>Elżbieta Bosak was born on November 8, 1985 in Wrocław, Poland. She is the youngest daughter of Jan Bosak, former commander of the Polish Special Forces unit GROM. She is also the younger sister of Zofia Bosak. Growing up, her father favored Zofia, causing a rift between them. Despite this, Zofia was highly protective of her sister.</p>

<p>Ela's grandfather played a significant role in her life. He would often share stories with her about his time as a Cichociemny of the exiled Polish Army during World War II and how he had endured a three-month-long siege of Wrocław. He nurtured her defiant spirit and taught her that “higher damage is done by striking a supply chain than by neutralizing a man.” This defiant personality caused Ela to initially struggle to commit to the strict military lifestyle.</p>

<p>Ela attended her father's military school along with her sister but often experienced several difficulties. She was bullied constantly due to the special attention she received as the GROM Commander's daughter. An incident six months before her graduation resulted in her expulsion. She had a short-lived transition in another academy, before her lack of attendance caused her to be transferred to a small local high school.</p>

<p>After graduation, she left Poland behind and set out for Berlin to experience life on her own terms. There she studied Fine Arts, but her interest started to fade as the appeal of her old life slowly caught up with her. Her reputation for using military paraphernalia in her art attracted the owner of a small private security company, who offered her a job. Craving the adventure and financial independence, Ela accepted, hoping that her role as contractor would differ from the simplistic compliance she experienced at the military academy.</p>
