<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>Collinn McKinley enrolled in the Marine Corps at 18 and earned several commendations in his service jacket for his aggressive quick-thinking, achieving Master Sergeant despite a few minor infractions on his record. After his third tour, he left the Marines and entered the Secret Service in close-protection detail. McKinley's agility was instrumental in saving Secretary of State Baldwin's life when insurgents attacked the U.S. diplomatic junket. Baldwin later went on to become President and requested McKinley be assigned to the Presidential Protective Division. McKinley has spent over a decade in Washington, protecting important political figures. He is the foremost expert in close protection detail, and with President Baldwin finishing his second term, McKinley has received high endorsements for his transition into Rainbow.</p>

<p>I've learned to read between the lines, and when it comes to Specialist Collinn "Warden" McKinley, that's where the real story lies. His role as protector came easily to him between butting heads with his strict, hardworking father and defending his brothers at school, but it became more deeply ingrained during his three tours with the Marines.</p>

<p>McKinley's service with the Secret Service reads like a Washington gossip column/spy novel. During the attack on then Secretary-of-State Baldwin, the attackers used flashbangs, smoke grenades, and heavy suppressing fire to separate the protection detail. McKinley realized all their evacuation routes had been compromised and evacuated Baldwin alone. The incident clarified the reason behind McKinley's special glasses, but it's also become indicative of his modus operandi… his off-the-cuff attitude. He's never been wrong and I fear he'll rely on instinct until it finally fails him.</p>
