<h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
<p>A North Korean by birth, Chul Kyung Hwa doesn't remember much of his early life. As a child, he and his family defected from the oppressive country and made their way across Asia in an attempt to eventually reach the Republic of Korea. Throughout it all, everyone impressed upon Chul Kyung that anything he said or any strange behavior would get them caught... it was life or death. So he buried his emotions deep, lest he betray his parents and be responsible for their capture; he became a stone to the outside world. During the journey, his older brother drowned while they were crossing a river. They then stayed in a safe house for over a month in near silence before taking a train ride that resulted in soldiers arresting two fellow defectors. His mother later grew sick and was slowing them down during a jungle crossing. After they were forced to leave his mother behind, Chul's father urged him not to cry so as to not alert nearby armed patrols. Gaining asylum in South Korea, it was not the happy life they'd envisioned. The loss of his family proved too much for Chul Kyung's father, who committed suicide, leaving his son an orphan. Chul Kyung remained a stone, never showing emotion, never betraying his inner thoughts.</p>

<p>Chul Kyung was adopted into the Hwa family, who believed it best if he forget his past, which started by changing his full name to Chul Kyung Hwa. Chul Kyung was actively encouraged to forget his real name and he obliged. It was another form of camouflage. He grew up in a system of rules and codes of conduct, and they provided him with a reason to be stoic, to follow orders. He could hide behind the rules. Chul's trauma showed during his adolescence as he became reclusive and was a slow reader, however, he later showed great improvement and focus by improving his grades.</p>
